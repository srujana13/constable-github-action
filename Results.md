## Methods: 

 - We chose 5 open source projects to see how likely are the participants to contribute to these and asked them to compare this with the Constable score.
 - We monitored the debugging session with each participant to understand their thought process and kept track of the time they spent on each repository. 
 - We also questioned them on how like are they to use this application in the future and what are the additonal features that they would like to see.

The afore-mentioned chart describes the scores that were awarded to each repository. For each repository, we have collected the mean score awarded by each participant to that repository, mode (maximum count) of the score awarded by each participant to that repository and the score awarded by the Github Constable Application to that repository. We observed that the participants looked for code coverage, issues description, badges in README files as some of the important measures before awarding the scores to the repositories. Whereas on the other hand, the Github Constable Action project analyzed the repositories for the presence of certain files like License, Contributing, etc. for awarding the score to the repositories.
